# Examination System (C#)

This is a **console-based Examination System** built in C#.  
It allows creating subjects and associating them with exams (Practical or Final).  
The system supports **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)** and **True/False (T/F)** questions, with input validation to ensure correct data entry.  
Students can take the exam interactively, submit their answers, and view their grades with correct answers at the end.  

## Features
- Create subjects and link them with exams.
- Two types of exams:
  - **Practical Exam** (MCQ only).
  - **Final Exam** (MCQ and True/False).
- Input validation for IDs, marks, and answer choices.
- Interactive exam session where the student:
  1. Reads the questions.
  2. Enters answers.
  3. Gets grade and correct answers at the end.
- Designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles for easy extension and maintainability.
